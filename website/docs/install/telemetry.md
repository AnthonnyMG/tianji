# Telemetry

## About Anonymous Telemetry  

To enhance the user experience, we have **enabled anonymous telemetry by default** in your self-hosted Tianji service.  

We understand that data privacy is important to you. Rest assured, this telemetry has the following characteristics:  

- **Completely Anonymous**: We do not collect any personally identifiable information or service content.  
- **Extremely Limited Scope**: It only includes basic usage data, helping us minimally understand Tianji's usage to continuously improve the product.  
- **Fully Transparent**: All telemetry data transmissions can be observed in your serviceâ€™s network panel, ensuring complete transparency.  

Additionally, we fully respect your choice. If you prefer to **disable anonymous telemetry entirely**, simply set the following environment variable:  

```bash
DISABLE_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=1
```

For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to the Environment Variables Documentation.

With this approach, we aim to improve Tianji while ensuring privacy and security. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us!
